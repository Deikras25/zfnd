The Freedom of the Press Foundation now accepts [cryptocurrency donations](https://freedom.press/donate/cryptocurrency/), including ZEC. "We plan to add more cryptocurrencies soon," [according to the announcement](https://freedom.press/news/you-can-now-support-freedom-press-foundation-using-cryptocurrency/), "including support for donating to a shielded Zcash address." The Freedom of the Press Foundation joins nonprofits like the [Courage Foundation](https://couragefound.org/donate/) and the [Internet Archive](https://archive.org/donate/cryptocurrency/).

We hope to see more charities and advocacy groups use Zcash in the near future, thereby offering their donors a robustly private option. It is not a coincidence that freedom-oriented organizations are early adopters of Zcash. They understand that privacy protects autonomy, especially in repressive environments.

If you work with a nonprofit that is interested in accepting cryptocurrency donations but not sure how to go about it, feel free to get in touch! Our general email address is contact@z.cash.foundation.
