We are delighted to announce that [Henry de Valence](https://www.hdevalence.ca/) has joined the Zcash Foundation as our Principal Cryptographic Researcher. Henry brings significant technical expertise and experience to the table, having recently worked on projects such as the [fastest Bulletproofs implementation](https://doc.dalek.rs/bulletproofs/), [composable transcripts for zero-knowledge proofs](https://medium.com/@hdevalence/merlin-flexible-composable-transcripts-for-zero-knowledge-proofs-28d9fda22d9a), [Ristretto](https://ristretto.group/), and [accelerating elliptic curves](https://medium.com/@hdevalence/accelerating-edwards-curve-arithmetic-with-parallel-formulas-ac12cf5015be).

Further in the past, Henry [designed and implemented](https://blog.cloudflare.com/sidh-go/) a hybrid X25519-SIDH post-quantum key exchange for TLS 1.3, collaborated on an [anonymous
reputation system](https://patternsinthevoid.net/hyphae/hyphae.pdf) for censorship circumvention, and worked on [cryptanalysis of lattice-based cryptosystems](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-319-56620-7_2), solving the principal ideal problem in multiquadratic number fields.

At the Zcash Foundation, Henry will focus on accelerating zero-knowledge proofs on two fronts: improving the implementations of proof systems themselves, as well as tooling that makes them easier to use and deploy in applications. We hope that youâ€™re just as excited as we are to see his future work!
