We are pleased to say that FROST has been accepted into the [Selected Areas in Cryptography (SAC) 2020 Conference](https://sac2020.ca/), which took place last week. We thank our reviewers for their helpful feedback and we will be publishing the updated and final version of our paper in the next week.

The full video from our presentation of FROST can be found [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3RX4IXAtrE). We will also be presenting FROST at the upcoming [NIST workshop on threshold schemes](https://csrc.nist.gov/events/2020/MPTS2020).

Next steps for FROST involve finishing the implementation and the ZIP for the use of FROST specifically within the Zcash protocol. We have finished our [first reference implementation](https://git.uwaterloo.ca/ckomlo/frost) using Ristretto as the underlying curve, and now we are working on a FROST-RedJubJub implementation to sign Zcash transactions. We hope to finish this implementation in the following weeks and look forward to presenting to the community soon!
