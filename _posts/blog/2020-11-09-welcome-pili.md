Before that she was at Red Hat, a leader in the open source world, working as a solution engineer. Pili has worked for a variety of companies varying in size from successful startups to Fortune 500 companies.

Pili is passionate about Open Source Software and in particular software for the common good and feels privileged and excited that she gets to work with nonprofits, working towards enabling the right to privacy for people everywhere.
