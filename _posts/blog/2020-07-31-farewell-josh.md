After an incredible three year tenure as Zcash Foundation's inaugural Executive Director, Josh Cincinnati is resigning from his position effective today. The Board is sorry to see our excellent first commander, truly worthy of [his name](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lucius_Quinctius_Cincinnatus), depart our ranks, but we're excited for his future endeavors, both inside and outside of the Zcash community. We're also excited to start a new chapter at the Foundation.

The process to carefully select someone to fill Josh's very large shoes is ongoing; we've planned on this transition for some time. Until we're certain we've found the right ED, the ZF Board will collectively guide the organization and you can expect ZF activities to proceed uninterrupted. The Foundation's eminently versatile Director, Antonie Hodge, will lead on execution of our current roadmap alongside our diligent and entrepreneurial engineering team, and Josh will consult on finding his replacement. 

Josh was the first hire of the Foundation's Board three years ago, whereupon he set to work to build the organization from the ground up. He oversaw the Foundation's expansion to provide meaningful decentralization of the Zcash ecosystem, and was critical in articulating and executing on Zcash's "2-of-2 multisig" governance structure. In addition to hiring and managing the Foundation's exemplary team and setting the Foundation's strategy and roadmap each year, he was the friendly face of the Foundation so many of you met at our Zcon events and a guiding voice during the dev fund debate. 

Josh has been and will remain a principled and staunch supporter of decentralizing power in the Zcash ecosystem. We are indebted to Josh for all his contributions. He taught us all to "think different" and to always expect that "[one last thing](https://www.flickr.com/photos/182097794@N06/48238879006/in/album-72157709530260352/)." Look forward to an upcoming post from Josh on parting thoughts and hints at what he's moving on to next!
