# ZCash Foundation Website

## General Instructions For Developers

> The tl;dr is that almost everything we're currently keeping here: https://github.com/ZcashFoundation/
> ...should be part of our Jekyll instance, displayable as normal, non-GitHub interface web pages. That way we can continue using GitHub for workflow, and people who are comfortable with it can navigate our files there, but everyone else is able to look at the regular website. Since we're mostly working with .md files anyway, I think that's pretty doable. For reference, here is the current state of our website: https://github.com/ZcashFoundation/zcashfoundation.github.io

### Priorities

> My technical priorities for the website:
>  -  Fast-loading
>  -  Minimal dependencies
>  -  Easy to maintain
>  -  Doesn't break any existing URLs / redirect anything that moves  
> Not breaking URLs is a little tricky because there are a million links to our GitHub repos floating around the internet — perhaps the easiest thing will be to archive everything on GitHub and add disclaimers to each document like "please go look at our website instead because it's the maintained source of truth." Suggestions welcome.
