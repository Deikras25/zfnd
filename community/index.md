Zcash has a vibrant community of developers, users, and enthusiasts. Here's where they congregate online:

- [Forum](https://forum.zcashcommunity.com/)
- [Chat](https://chat.zcashcommunity.com/)
- [Subreddit](https://reddit.com/r/zec)

In addition, many Zcash community members are active on Twitter. We use the handle [@ZcashFoundation](https://twitter.com/zcashfoundation).

As for "meatspace," the Foundation facilitates a [meetups program](https://www.zfnd.org/meetups/) and runs the [annual Zcon gathering](https://www.zfnd.org/zcon/).

The Zcash Company is a separate organization, but its [website](https://z.cash/) and [Twitter account](https://twitter.com/zcashco) are also useful.
