excerpt: "How the Zcash Foundation Grants Program works."
---

The Zcash Foundation ran a Grants Program in [2017](https://github.com/ZcashFoundation/GrantProposals-2017Q4) and [2018](https://github.com/ZcashFoundation/GrantProposals-2018Q2), in order to fund promising research, development, and other projects by community members. The Grants Program was primarily organized through GitHub and documented [on the Foundation's blog](https://www.zfnd.org/tags/#grants) as well as the [general mailing list](https://lists.z.cash.foundation/mailman/listinfo/general).

We are currently designing a nimbler funding process, with details to be announced in the coming months. If you want to be notified when it debuts, [please subscribe to our newsletter](https://buttondown.email/zcashfoundation)!
