The minutes of meetings at which such votes are taken shall record such disclosure, abstention, and rationale for approval.

The Chairman and any officers they deem necessary shall maintain a list of potential conflicts of interest on file with existing Directors, who will be required to submit and update this information as soon as a conflict arises. Additionally, prospective Directors will be required to submit their potential conflicts of interest prior to their election and the information will be made available to all members of the existing Board, in a manner determined at the Chairman's discretion.
