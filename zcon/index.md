Zcon1 will take place immediately after [Crypto Summer School](https://summerschool-croatia.cs.ru.nl/2019/), also located in Croatia. Summer School is a prime event for researchers interested in recent development in cryptography, aiming to bring together students, academics, and industry professionals. The event examines internet privacy from a real-world perspective. In case you need another reason to hop on a plane!

During Zcon1, conference attendees will communicate and organize in the [#zcon channel](https://chat.zcashcommunity.com/channel/zcon) of the Zcash Community Chat. The URL is `chat.zcashcommunity.com`, and can be accessed on the mobile web, through Rocket.Chat's [iOS app](https://itunes.apple.com/app/rocket-chat/id1148741252), or through the [Android app](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=chat.rocket.android).
