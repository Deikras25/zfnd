Zcon1 will take place immediately after [Crypto Summer School](https://summerschool-croatia.cs.ru.nl/2019/), also located in Croatia. Summer School is a prime event for researchers interested in recent development in cryptography, aiming to bring together students, academics, and industry professionals. The event examines internet privacy from a real-world perspective. In case you need another reason to hop on a plane!
