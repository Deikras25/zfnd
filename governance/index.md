excerpt: "The Zcash Foundation Community Governance Process"
---

The Zcash Foundation's first governance process coincided with [our inaugural conference](https://www.zfnd.org/blog/zcon0-recap/) in 2018. It was [announced](https://www.zfnd.org/blog/zcon0-and-community-governance/) in April, [further explained](https://www.zfnd.org/blog/governance-voting/) in June, and concluded later that month.

[General measures](https://github.com/ZcashFoundation/Elections/tree/master/2018-Q2/General-Measures) and [board nominations](https://github.com/ZcashFoundation/Elections/tree/master/2018-Q2/Board-Nominations) were submitted and discussed on GitHub, where they are [available to review](https://github.com/ZcashFoundation/Elections).

In July, the Foundation released a blog post [detailing the governance results](https://www.zfnd.org/blog/governance-results/) and our planned responses. Notably, Amber Baldet and Ian Miers were instated as new members of the Board of Directors.
