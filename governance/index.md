excerpt: "What you need to know about Zcash governance."

As a protocol, Zcash is governed by the [Zcash Improvement Proposal process](https://zips.z.cash/). The ZIP process provides an [open venue and structure](https://github.com/zcash/zips/blob/master/zip-0000.rst) for collectively evaluating changes to Zcash.

Anyone can submit a draft ZIP. Draft ZIPs are debated by the community at large, then accepted or rejected by the ZIP editors. Currently there are two ZIP editors â€” Daira Hopwood represents the Electric Coin Company and George Tankersley represents the Zcash Foundation.

Decisions from the ZIP process are written into the Zcash specification, as well as the software that runs the network. The changes are "ratified" on-chain when the majority of the network adopts the upgrade and doesn't break consensus. ([Sapling](https://z.cash/upgrade/sapling/) provides an example.)

Zcash Foundation executive director Josh Cincinnati wrote ["Zcash Governance: A Step Toward Decentralization"](https://www.zfnd.org/blog/multisig-governance/) to explain the relevant power dynamics in depth.

## 2018 Q2

The Zcash Foundation's first governance process coincided with [our inaugural conference](https://www.zfnd.org/blog/zcon0-recap/) in 2018. It was [announced](https://www.zfnd.org/blog/zcon0-and-community-governance/) in April, [further explained](https://www.zfnd.org/blog/governance-voting/) in June, and concluded later that month.

[General measures](https://github.com/ZcashFoundation/Elections/tree/master/2018-Q2/General-Measures) and [board nominations](https://github.com/ZcashFoundation/Elections/tree/master/2018-Q2/Board-Nominations) were submitted and discussed on GitHub, where they are [available to review](https://github.com/ZcashFoundation/Elections).

In July, the Foundation released a blog post [detailing the governance results](https://www.zfnd.org/blog/governance-results/) and our planned responses. Notably, Amber Baldet and Ian Miers were instated as new members of the Board of Directors.
